From elementary school to university, I have been constantly practicing my drawing and artistic skills. Hence, I have created a lot of interesting <a class="one" href="works.html">works</a>. Secondly, I like to travel a lot, and almost every holiday I travel to other countries. The photo on the right was taken when I went to Bohol, Philippines. I especially like the seaside, in addition to the beautiful scenery also what I see during the trip can inspire my design ideas and expand my horizons. I often bring a sketchbook or iPad to quickly record those beautiful scenery moments. Besides design and travel, I like tasting food. I feel that eating food brings me a lot of positive energy and happiness, which helps inspiration of my creative works.</p>
